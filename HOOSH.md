# Hoosh

A powerful command-line AI assistant built in Rust, designed to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities with your local
development environment.

> **Hoosh** (هوش) means "intelligence", "intellect", or "mind" in Persian.

## Features

- **Multi-backend Support**: Support for multiple AI providers
    - **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo)
    - **Anthropic** (Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus)
    - **Together AI** (200+ open source models)
    - **Ollama** (local models for offline operation)
- **Tool Integration**: Execute system commands, file operations, and custom tools through AI
- **Conversation Management**: Maintain context across multiple interactions
- **Permission System**: Control what actions the AI can perform on your system
- **Review/Autopilot Modes**: Toggle between reviewing every operation or running on autopilot (Shift+Tab)
- **Configurable**: Customize behavior through TOML configuration files
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors (rate limits, server
  errors) with real-time user feedback through the event system
- **CLI Interface**: Intuitive command-line interface with subcommands

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 2024 edition or later
- Cargo package manager

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nomad-prime/hoosh
cd hoosh
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be available at `target/release/hoosh`.

## Quick Start

### Initial Setup

Run the interactive setup wizard to configure Hoosh:

```bash
hoosh setup
```

The wizard will guide you through:
- Selecting your preferred AI backend (Anthropic, OpenAI, Together AI, or Ollama)
- Configuring API credentials (environment variable or stored in config)
- Choosing your default model

You can re-run `hoosh setup` at any time to reconfigure your settings.

## Usage

### Basic Chat

Start a conversation with the AI (interactive TUI mode):

```bash
hoosh
```

### Specify Backend

Choose a specific backend for your conversation:

```bash
hoosh --backend anthropic
```

### Directory Access

Allow the AI to access specific directories:

```bash
hoosh --add-dir ./src
```

### Continue Last Conversation

Resume your previous conversation:

```bash
hoosh --continue
```

### Review vs Autopilot Mode

Hoosh operates in two modes to control how operations are executed:

#### Review Mode (Default)

- Shows an approval dialog for **every tool call** before execution
- Displays the tool name and allows you to approve or reject
- Provides maximum control and visibility over AI actions
- Ideal when you want to inspect each operation

#### Autopilot Mode

- Automatically executes all tool calls without approval dialogs
- Still respects the permission system (asks for risky operations)
- Ideal for faster iteration when you trust the AI's actions

**Toggle modes**: Press `Shift+Tab` during a session to switch between Review and Autopilot modes.

The current mode is always displayed in the status bar:

- `[Review]` - You'll see an approval dialog for each tool call
- `[Autopilot]` - Tool calls execute automatically (after permission checks)

### Permission Management

Hoosh includes a security-focused permission system to control risky operations.

#### Permission Dialogs

When the AI attempts a potentially risky operation (file writes, deletions, bash commands), you'll see a permission
dialog with three options:

- **[y] Yes, once** - Allow this specific operation only
- **[n] No** - Deny this operation
- **[t] Trust project** - Grant permission for all operations within the current project directory

#### Trust Project Mode

The "Trust Project" option provides convenient authorization for trusted codebases:

1. When prompted for permission, select "Trust project" (press `T` or select and press Enter)
2. All risky operations within the current project directory will be automatically approved
3. A visual indicator (`🔓 Project Trusted`) appears in the TUI header
4. Trust is session-only and cleared when you exit Hoosh

**Revoking Trust:**

Use the `/untrust` command to revoke project-wide trust mid-session:

```
/untrust
```

This will re-enable permission dialogs for all operations.

#### Security Considerations

- Trust is limited to the current working directory and its subdirectories
- Trust is never persisted to disk - each session starts fresh
- Operations outside the trusted directory still require permission
- Safe operations (reading files, listing directories) are always allowed
- Permission checks happen **in addition to** approval dialogs in Review mode

### Configuration

Manage configuration settings:

```bash
# View current configuration
hoosh config show

# Set default backend
hoosh config set default_backend anthropic

# Set default agent
hoosh config set default_agent hoosh_coder

# Set default verbosity (quiet, normal, verbose, debug)
hoosh config set verbosity debug

# Configure backend API keys
hoosh config set openai_api_key sk-...
hoosh config set anthropic_api_key sk-ant-...
hoosh config set together_ai_api_key tgp_...

# Configure backend models
hoosh config set openai_model gpt-4
hoosh config set anthropic_model claude-sonnet-4.5
hoosh config set together_ai_model Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8
hoosh config set ollama_model llama3

# Configure backend base URLs (for custom endpoints)
hoosh config set openai_base_url https://api.openai.com/v1
hoosh config set ollama_base_url http://localhost:11434

# Configure backend temperature (0.0-2.0)
hoosh config set openai_temperature 0.7
hoosh config set anthropic_temperature 1.0
```

## Supported Backends

### OpenAI

```bash
# Install Ollama first: https://ollama.ai
# Pull a model: ollama pull llama3

hoosh config set ollama_model llama3
hoosh config set default_backend ollama
```

No API key required - runs completely offline!

## Configuration File

Hoosh uses a TOML configuration file located at `~/.config/hoosh/config.toml`. You can customize various aspects of the
application including:

- **default_backend**: The backend to use by default (e.g., "anthropic", "openai", "ollama")
- **default_agent**: The default agent to use for conversations
- **verbosity**: Logging verbosity level (quiet, normal, verbose, debug)
- **review_mode**: Whether to require approval for tool calls (true/false)
- **backends**: Backend-specific configurations
    - **api_key**: Authentication key for the backend
    - **model**: Model to use for this backend
    - **base_url**: Custom API endpoint URL
    - **temperature**: Sampling temperature (0.0-2.0)
- **agents**: Custom agent configurations with prompts and tags

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: This configuration file contains sensitive API keys. Ensure the file permissions are set to
> 0600 (owner read/write only) to prevent unauthorized access. Never commit this file to version control.
